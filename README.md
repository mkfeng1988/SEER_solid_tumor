# SEER (solid tumor)
R code for SEER data analysis of solid tumor in different populations.

### Goal
Create reproducible report for different cancer types and parameters with minimum modifications on user’s side to observe patterns of different cancer types in populations. 

### Data source
<https://seer.cancer.gov/data/access.html>

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) collects and publishes cancer data through a coordinated system of strategically placed cancer registries which cover near 30% of the USA population. 
Currently there are 18 SEER registries in the USA.

### Parameters in the code
* Years of diagnoses (2004+);
* Age groups at diagnosis;
* Cancer type (defined by ICD-O-3 codes together with Histology codes);
* Which SEER registry to compare with other 17 SEER registries;
* How to describe the extent of disease progression in cancer patients (by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system or Grade system);
* Which edition of AJCC staging to apply (6th or combination of 6th and 7th);

Some other parameters are also available to be edited, but they are secondary.

### Statistics in the report
* Characteristics of study participants
* Crude incidence rates by strata
* Age-adjusted incidence rates by strata
* Kaplan-Meier survival curves
* Cox proportional hazards models


### Directions
__1.  Create this folders' structure:__
```
|   Project_SEER_solid_tumor.Rproj  - always start a new R session by opening this file first
|   
+---code
|   +---generic
|   |       analyze.R
|   |       functions.R
|   |       map_SEER.R
|   |       map_template.R
|   |       subset.R
|   |       
|   \---specific
|       \---Colorectal
|               main.R              - main file, which controls all other files
|               report_docx_html.Rmd

|               
\---data
    +---case_listing
    |       caselisting_data.dic    - download from SEER*Stat prior running the code and place under this name
    |       caselisting_data.txt    - download from SEER*Stat prior running the code and place under this name

    +---intermediate
    \---public
        \---data_geo
                mapcoord.RData
```

Additional subfolders and files should be automatically generated by running code in 'main.R' file:
```

|       \---Colorectal

__2. Download data from SEER Program__

2.1. Request access <https://seer.cancer.gov/data/access.html>;
2.2. Install SEERStat when access is granted;
2.3. Download all records from SEERStat’s 'Case Listing Session' by following rules:

I. In Selection Tab of SEERStat: 
a) uncheck all boxes 
b) {Race, Sex, Year Dx, Registry, County.Year of diagnosis} = '2004','2005','2006','2007','2008','2009','2010','2011','2012','2013','2014'

II. In Table Tab of SEERStat pre-select columns to speed up download of the data 
Columns: "Age recode with <1 year olds",	
	"Race recode (White, Black, Other)",	
	"Sex",

III.  Execute session.

IV. Matrix -> Export -> Results as Text file -> save (.txt & .dic files fill be generated) under names 'caselisting_data.txt' and 'caselisting_data.dic' in ./data/case_listing.

__3. Run code in 'Main.R' file for Colorectal cancer typecases__

Running 'Main.R' should be enough to generate reports.

In case of any issues here are directions on how to run code line-by-line (with all dependencies run separately):

```
-sequence-  -file-     -lines-
1.          main.R      1-179
2.          analyze.R   1-47
3.          subset.R    All        - the most time concuming part
4.          analyze.R   55-1002
5.          map_SEER.R  All
6.          analyze.R   1008-1016
7.          main.R      185-209
```

__4. Run code with different parameters__




### 50 states map
The map can be reproduced without access to SEER data files.
To do this you will need to download only 3 files: 'map_SEER.R' (from this GitHub repository), 'mapcoord.RData' (from this GitHub repository), and 'us.1990_2015.19ages.adjusted.txt' (see a link shown in comments in 'map_SEER.R'). 
Don't forget to modify file pathes in 'map_SEER.R'. Here is a map:
